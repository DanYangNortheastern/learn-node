- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

order:

"foo" (Initial execution, before the event loop, from calling foo())
"done" (Initial execution, before the event loop, from the console.log after calling foo())
"Read Error" (From the poll phase of the event loop, after the fs.readFile operation completes)
