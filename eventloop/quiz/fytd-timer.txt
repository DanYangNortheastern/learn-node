- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

order:

"foo" (initial execution, before the event loop, from foo(2))
"baz" (initial execution, before the event loop, from foo(2))
"foo" (initial execution, before the event loop, from foo(1))
"baz" (initial execution, before the event loop, from foo(1))
"2 : bar" (from the timers phase, setTimeout callback from foo(2))
"1 : bar" (from the timers phase, setTimeout callback from foo(1))
